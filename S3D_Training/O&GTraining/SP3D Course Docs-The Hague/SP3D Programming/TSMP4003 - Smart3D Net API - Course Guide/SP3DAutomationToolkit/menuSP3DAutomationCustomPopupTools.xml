  <!-- 
  As an Advanced Configuration, you can add your own 
    MenuItem entries or Menu Entries here. 
  Ensure you do not use an id attribute for your menuitems, especially if 
    you are copying the entries from the product menu xml files.
  You can use all the Menuitem constructs as allowed in the product - i.e. with 
    action=NormalCmd or action=HighPriorityCmd 
    or an existing entry like action=mnuViewFit or action=mnuEditProperties
    
  If you edit this file incorrectly, you will get error messageboxes during
  startup of SmartPlant/Marine 3D.
  
  To serve as an example, this file as delivered has entries commented out.
