If you have disk file checking active (the default) and activate PFE by
clicking the left mouse button in the title bar area of an edit window,
you may not be able to use the mouse to click the buttons in any dialog
that appears alerting you to a change of the corresponding disk file.
You can operate the dialog using the keyboard; use the Tab key to select
the button you want to click, and press Return to click it
