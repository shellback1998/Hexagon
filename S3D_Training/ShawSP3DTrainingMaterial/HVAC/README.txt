Intergraph did not have labs posted in Siebel. It was a long shot anyway, in the past they’d have you come and take the class, again, if you wanted the latest labs for the latest software version. Won’t hurt to ask anyway, so I’ll let you know what they say about getting an electronic copy. Meanwhile, the attachments are the pdf of the old lab I had.  The training plant does not have the presets implied by the labs, so some improvisation will be needed:

1.	Delete all existing graphics, including grids (this is mentioned in step by step labs)
2.	Create new HVAC hierarchy system in Area2 as shown in pg 9 pic.
3.	Create new grid system “HVAC_CS” for HVAC labs:
a.	At Elev 0, origin at global 0,0,0 (me thinks), 80ft x 80ft grid, vertical gridlines spaced 10ft, hor grids spaced 8ft. See pg 36 of the labs for detail
b.	At Elev 15ft, similar grid but vertical gridlines spaced 2ft and hor grids spaced 4ft. See pg 37 for detail.

If the guys get stuck with something that may be missing let me know, I’ll see what we can do to adapt. I’m guessing you have someone who can layout these grids in the training plant(s). If not the case let me know and I’ll lend a hand.

The 2 attachments are half the scanned document in each.

If any questions just let me know.
